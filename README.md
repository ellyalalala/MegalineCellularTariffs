Analysis of tariffs on a small sample of clients

You are an analyst at Megaline, a federal mobile operator. Clients are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.
You will have to do a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of clients. At your disposal are the data of 500 Megaline users: who they are, where they are from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each person sent in 2018. You need to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion - which tariff is better.
